# LuhnAlgorithmDart
The Luhn algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; 
it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers
use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.
